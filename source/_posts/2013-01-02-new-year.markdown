I've decided to migrate my website from WordPress to [Octopress](http://octopress.org/).

Octopress is a static website generator, built on [Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll), 
with some goodies Jekyll doesn't ship with.

For a while now my website has been the odd man out. Updating a WordPress site just doesn't 
fit with the rest of my workflow. I now spend most of my time editing text files and 
issuing commands from a terminal, and I store everything I build in git. 
Having my site generated from content stored in a git repository feels more natural 
to me now than storing it in a database edited via a browser interface. 
There's no mental effort in switching to updating my website and back. It's now 
just one project among many, all using the same set of tools and environments.

I'll be deploying the site to Github, at least for now. The workflow for Octopress in general,
and deployment via GitHub in particular, is very simple. Performance should also improve, as
serving a static site should be faster than a database-driven CMS, regardless of where I host it.
Having to cache the hell out of WordPress, and thereby turning it into a 'static' site anyway, seems silly.

We'll see how this goes. I'm be moving some content over from the old site for a while, 
and letting the rest of it fall off the internet.
